Description:
The code is a basic password generator that creates a password based on the user's preferences for the number of characters, numbers, and symbols. It combines these elements randomly to form a password.

Algorithm & Methods Used:

User Input:
Takes user input for the desired number of characters, numbers, and symbols for the password.

List Creation:
Creates lists containing characters, numbers, and symbols to choose from.


Password Generation:
Uses loops to randomly select characters, numbers, and symbols based on user input and appends them to a list called password_list.

Password Presentation:
Presents the generated password list to the user.

Shuffling and String Conversion:
Shuffles the elements in the password_list for security and then converts the list into a string to create the final password.

Points:
Allows user input for password criteria (characters, numbers, symbols).
Utilizes random selection to form the password.
Ensures the password has a mix of characters, numbers, and symbols for security.
Shuffles the elements in the password for added unpredictability.

#Project Description:
Project Title: Rock-Paper-Scissors Game Implementation in Python.

Objective: This project aims to create an interactive command-line game where users can play rock-paper-scissors against the computer.

Features:
Interactive ASCII art representing the game console.
User input for name and move selection.
Classic rock-paper-scissors game logic with result display.
Presentation of the user's most recent move.
Code encapsulated in functions for readability and reusability.


Algorithms Used:

Random Selection Algorithm:
Utilizes Python's random.choice() to simulate the computer's move, ensuring a random selection from available choices.
Ensures fairness by generating the computer's move without bias.

Game Logic Algorithm:
Implements classic game logic to determine the winner based on user and computer moves.
Conditions evaluate user and computer choices to determine the game outcome (win, lose, tie).

Methods and Techniques Employed:

User Interaction:
input() function to gather user inputs for name and game move.
Capitalization of user inputs (capitalize()) to standardize move entries.


Data Structures:
Lists to store available moves (rock, paper, scissors) and selections for password generation.


String Manipulation:
Concatenation of strings to form the password.
Formatting strings for output presentation.
